# Welcome to Pro Management!

## I created this Full Stack project management application where I can add clients, projects related to them, and update the status of the projects.

## I used GraphQL and MongoDB on the backend, and React/Javascript on the frontend. The styling was done using Bootstrap.

The functionality of this application includes using the React-router-dom to transfer between pages,
addind and removing items from the shopping cart, and seeing each item's information when opening a Modal.


# Getting Started

To install the required dependencies run `npm install`.

Server: On the server folder, run `npm run dev`
Client: On the client folder, run `npm start`
